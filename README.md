# â˜… Calculator in C â˜…

This is a basic calculator program written in C that offers a variety of mathematical operations. The program includes functions for factorial calculation, combinations, permutations, and several arithmetic and trigonometric operations. It is intended as a learning project and may require further improvements and debugging.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Basic Arithmetic:** âž¤ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Power and Roots:** âž¤ Exponentiation, Square, Cube, Square Root, Cube Root
- **Logarithmic Functions:** âž¤ Log base 10 and Natural Log (ln)
- **Factorial:** âž¤ Calculation using iterative multiplication
- **Combinatorics:** âž¤ Permutations (nPr) and Combinations (nCr)
- **Trigonometric Functions:** âž¤ Sine, Cosine, Tangent and their Inverse functions
- **Additional Operations:** âž¤ Absolute value, rounding, ceiling, modulus (and more)

> âš  **Note:** Some operations such as differentiation, integration, epsilon calculations, and a few others are referenced but not fully implemented or may contain errors. The menu and corresponding case statements might not match the expected functionality in all instances.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- The math library (linked with `-lm`)

## âš™ Known Issues

- **Data Type Inconsistencies:** The program uses inconsistent data types for input (e.g., reading integers into double variables) which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Menu and Operation Mismatches:** Some menu options do not correctly map to the intended operation in the switch-case block.
- **Unimplemented Functions:** Certain functions (e.g., `derive`) are referenced but not defined.
- **Input Validation:** There is minimal error checking and input validation.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- **Bug Fixes:** Address and correct the mismatches and bugs in arithmetic operations and function implementations.
- **Complete Missing Features:** Implement proper differentiation, integration, and other mathematical operations that are currently placeholders.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the menu display and add clear prompts and error messages.
- **Robust Input Handling:** Introduce validation to ensure users enter the correct data types.
